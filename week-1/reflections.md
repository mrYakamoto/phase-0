# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

**Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**
I learned about “How Mindfulness Can Improve Productivity, Focus, and Work Life Balance”, “Fogg Method,” “Flow,” “Timebox,” and “Learning Ruby the Hard Way.”

**What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**
“Time Boxing” is simply setting a time limit that will not be exceeded while attempting to complete a task. I can use this to both motivate more focus and avoid wasting too much time on any one subject.

**How do you manage your time currently?**
Currently, I write out the things I need to accomplish and schedule my day based on how long I think each task will take.

**Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**
Yes, I’m usually able to predict the time needed for my daily tasks.

**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**
I’ll definitely be conscious of time-boxing my tasks. Sometimes, I can become too focused on what turns out to be a largely insignificant detail and lose sight of the bigger picture. I’m interested in employing the Fogg method. Clearly identifying specific goals and the easiest ways to achieve them will be very helpful.

**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**
I’ve freed up a large part of my weekly schedule to dedicate to Phase 0 work. By keeping open communication with my classmates and instructor, I hope to stay on track and avoid wasting unnecessary time. Also, I’m to set specific goals I hope to achieve and make sure that I remain mindful of my progress through regular reflection.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

**What is a shell? What is “bash”**
A shell allows you to interface with the operating system. There are GUI (graphical user interface) like ‘Finder’ and CLI (command line interface) shells. Bash is a CLI which can be used to interface with the OS using only text.

**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**
Memorizing the commands is easy, but understanding the larger foundation and structure of what I’m doing is something that I spent most of my extra time researching and trying to figure out.

**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**
Yes, I didn’t have any problems getting all of the commands to work.

**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**
It’s hard to tell what’s “important” at this point, but I used cd, rm, ls, and mv most frequently in this exercise.

**Can you remember what each of the following does off the top of your head? Write what each does.**
pwd - prints the working directory
ls - lists files in a directory
mv - moves (renames) a file or directory
cd - changes the working directory
../  - moves back one level in the file structure
touch - creates a new empty file
mkdir - creates a new directory
less - displays a file’s contents one page at a time
rmdir - removes an empty directory
rm - removes a file
help - displays available shell commands

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

**If you were going to write instructions fro a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**
First, login to your GitHub account. There should be a little plus sign near the top right. Click on that and choose ‘new repository’ from the drop-down. In the new page, type in your repository name, choose to make it public or private, and add a license. Open the repository in your profile and on the bottom right of the page, clone the url.
Next, open your terminal, change directories to the directory you’d like to house your repository, and type “git clone CLONED-URL.”

**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**
I didn’t experience any problems setting up git and GitHub, but I learned the basic functions of Git and GitHub and how they are different.
