<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Great! It was awesome to pickup and implement a new skill so quickly to produce a concrete result.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It's going well. I didn't make use of too many yet, but I did some looking into <div> and <span> to help figure out their usages.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I didn't have any problems, since I don't really even know how to format in HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is very distinctly structured which I like. It seems like the same page can be made with no detail or with great hidden complexity to increase functionality. I haven't discovered any real pitfalls or frustration in HTML yet.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I've memorized which tags don't require a closing tag. Other than that, I check up on the HTML cheatsheet fairly often.
