- How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

I found Chrome's DevTools to be most useful for figuring out problem aspects of elements that I couldn't get positioned correctly. Scrolling through the items to see where margins were that I didn't know where there was very useful. It's real-time responsiveness makes it great for trying out options on elements.

- How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

All size properties of elements on the DOM can be adjusted using CSS. Specifically, "height" and "width" can easily be used to adjust size.


- What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which do you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute positions the object in relation to its first non-static ancestor element. Fixed positions it in relation to the browser window and doesn't scroll with the page. Static is the default and positions the element in its order in the document flow. Relative enables positioning the element in relation to its normal position. Distances can be specified to move it to the "left," "right," "top," or "bottom."

- What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

"Margin" is spacing created outside an element, "border" is the edge of the element itself, and "padding" is spacing created between the border of an element and an element inside it.

- What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I liked this challenge. The "position" and "display" values have been two of the more frustrating properties that I've had to play around with a lot to try and understand exactly what they do. This excercise provided some much needed practice to further cement the practice of these properties.
