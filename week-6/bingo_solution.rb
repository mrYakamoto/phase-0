# A Nested Array to Model a Bingo Board SOLO CHALLENGE

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Release 0: Pseudocode
# Outline:

# Create a method to generate a letter ( b, i, n, g, o) and a number (1-100)
  # Create array for letters in bingo. Randomly pick an element
  # from that array and combine with a random number 1-100.

# Check the called column for the number called.
  # check the letter corresponding column if there's a match for
  # the number.

# If the number is in the column, replace with an 'x'

# Display a column to the console
  # puts the corresponding element from each array to the console

# Display the board to the console (prettily)
  # puts each row of the updated bingo board to the console to make
  # the entire bingo board.
