**What does <pre><code>puts</code></pre> do?**

<pre><code>puts</code></pre> returns nil and prints to the console with a new line.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer is a number without a decimal. A float (floating-point
number) is a number with a decimal.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

Integer will round the quotient down to the nearest whole number.
Float division will provide a more precise quotient and include
numbers past the decimal.

```ruby
puts "There're #{24*365} hours in a normal year"

puts "There're between #{60*24*365*10+48*60} and #{60*24*365*10+72*60} minutes in a decade"
```

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and**
**division of numbers**

Ruby handles them in the same order of operations as mathematics.

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**

Integers are whole numbers and don't include a decimal. Floats
include a decimal.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**

Integer division will round the quotient down to the nearest
whole number. Float division will return an exact quotient,
including decimals.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are groups of letters. Strings are used to communicate
with users.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

local variables are used to store numbers, strings, arrays, and
other values. They can be used to easily repeat values instead of
typing them fully every time.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of**
**the basics?**

This was a good little refresher of some of the basics of Ruby.
I'm surprised at just how much I've forgotten after not looking
at it for 3 weeks.
